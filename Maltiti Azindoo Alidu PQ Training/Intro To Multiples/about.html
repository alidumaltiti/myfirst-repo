    <hr>
    <p class="box">
    I’m Maltiti Azindoo Alidu, a versatile professional with a background in Agricultural Technology (Biotechnology) and growing expertise in digital innovation, research, and community development. Born and raised in Tamale, I’ve spent most of my life in rural communities, which drives my passion for inclusive and sustainable development. 
    <br>With over 3 years’ experience spanning agriculture, health outreach, data analytics, and software development, I’ve worked with organizations like CSIR-SARI, MEDA, DevelopersHub.co, and Precision Quality. I’m currently part of the AWS re/Start Program, the AWS Emerging Talent Community, and the Power Learn Project’s Software Development scholarship, while also pursuing growth in data science and cybersecurity. 
    <br>I combine technical skills, project management, and community engagement to solve real-world problems, aiming to bridge development gaps in rural Ghana and beyond
